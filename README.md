## üí• Introduction
LetsMeet is a platform which allows you to schedule a Meet-up with details like Title, Location Image, Address and a description to get details about the meet-up like agenda, capacity etc. Front-End in build completely with NextJs and MongoDB is used to store meet-ups details. Then on landing page you will see list of the Meet-Ups and you can click on Show Details button to know full details of the meet-up. You also have option to create your own Meet-Up by clicking "Add New Meet-Up". 

## üí° Why did I build this?
In pandemic situation all the in-person meet-ups have been put on stop and that is something which affects a lot in terms of socialization, networking etc So I thought of making a platform where people can actually post their meet-ups and those who wants to join them can connect with them. It can be used by friends to schedule casual meet-ups, by community to organize meet-ups etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development

That's pretty easy. To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, we would recommend you to have <b>Git</b>, <b>NPM</b> and <b>Node.js</b> installed.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Once you run the Commands and get environment variables and everything fine, we are all set to run the app ‚úîÔ∏è
